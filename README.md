# Zmija-Portfolio

## Description
The task at hand was to create an interactive portfolio page. This project was built to showcase skills and talents to future employers that I hope to present this to. The motivation behind the project was to set myself up for success. This is achieved by developing a working webpage while continuously adding new projects that I complete throughout my experience at the bootcamp, highlighting concepts that I learned and applied. For the time being, there will be some placeholders as the moment but as I continue to complete more projects, the porfolio page will be updated accordingly.
